#NASA APOD

App.js: Axios api call is made to the NASA.gov api within an async function that fetches the necessary image data. 

The random image retrieved from the api is rendered along with the title of the image, a caption or 'explanation' as well as the date it was captured. 

The Astronomy Photo of the Day or APOD is updated daily with a title and description of the photo. These data, along with the title of the photo are 
rendered with the photo. 

A beautifully simple project, the APOD project is shows an understanding of data retrieval and state management. 

The API call is made in the useEffect() found in App.js.
